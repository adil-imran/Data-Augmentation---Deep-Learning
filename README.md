# Data-Augmentation---Deep-Learning
Tf dataset Citrus_leaves is demonstrated for the Data Augmentation deep learning.
# What is Data-Augmentation?
- Data augmentation is a technique to artificially create new training data from existing training data.
# Conclusion
- Model prediction accuracy is improved in the Data Augmentation.
- It added more training data.
- It increased the generalization of the model
